# Search Algorithms Exercises

## Overview
In this exercise, you'll practice two different implementations of the binary search algorithm:
* Iterative implementation
* Recursive implementation

Both implementations can be found in the `searches.js` file. The "test" folder also has test scripts for both versions of the algorithm.

Make sure that you completed the myGA module for Search Algorithms (link) before doing these exercises.

> **Note**: The myGA module links out to CodePen for a code challenge on the binary search algorithm. **This exercise is the same as the one here and is meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercises.**
