# Distribution Sorts Exercises

Let's practice what you learned about distribution sorts by implementing bucket sort.

Make sure that you completed the myGA module for Distribution Sorting Algorithms [link] before completing these exercises.

> **Note**: The myGA module links out to CodePen for a code challenge for bucket sort. **This exercise is the same as the one here and is meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercise.**

We're only going to practice implementing bucket sort here because it's a slightly more common interview question and a more foundational algorithm. If you're curious to see what radix sort looks like in JavaScript, check it out [here](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sorting/radix-sort).
