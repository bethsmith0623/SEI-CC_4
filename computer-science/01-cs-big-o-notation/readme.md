# Big O Notation

## Overview
This lesson covers the basics of Big O notation.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Big O Notation](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/511)
2. In-Class Exercise: [Analyzing Algorithms](exercises/BigOExercise.md)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Explain how Big O notation is used to describe algorithms.
- Define constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and factorial Big O runtimes.
- Analyze algorithms to determine their Big O runtime.

## Prerequisites
* None

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Resources
