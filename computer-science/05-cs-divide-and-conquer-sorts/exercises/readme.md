# Divide-and-Conquer Sorts Exercises

## Overview
There are two exercises to help you practice what you learned in the Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms lesson. We'll implement the two sorting algorithms:
* `MergeSort.js`
* `QuickSort.js`

This folder also contains test scripts that you can use on your code.

Make sure that you completed the myGA module for Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms (link) before completing these exercises.

> **Note**: The myGA module links out to a CodePen for code challenges for both merge sort and quick sort. **Those exercises are the same as the ones here and are meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercises.**

## Tip
In the `MergeSort.js` exercise, you have code for the merge helper algorithm. So really, you're just implementing the merge sort algorithm!
