### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

<p style="text-align:left">Within the context of the interaction between a browser and a web server:</p>

- **What is bidirectional communication?**

- **What is realtime communication?**

- How cool would it be to incorporate these concepts in our apps!

---
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lz5wBQE.png" width="600">
<br><br>

- With your pair, discuss what type of applications are made possible by _realtime bidirectional_ communication between clients and a server.

- Be prepared to share your thoughts in 2 minutes.

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

- We just discussed the kinds of cool apps that leverage realtime communications.

- So, what technology do we need to know as developers to incorporate realtime in our own apps...

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

- So far in SEI, we've learned quite a bit about the **HTTP protocol**.

- Who would like to remind us of **the process of communication between _client_ and _server_ when using HTTP**?

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

- From the beginning, HTTP implemented a _request_ / _response_ process.

- In HTTP, all communication is initiated by the client.

- The web server responds **once** to the client's request, and the "conversation" ends until the client sends another request.

- Obviously, HTTP is not our ticket to creating realtime apps, what is?...

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

- <p>As we learned in week one, it was the demand for modern web applications that led to the development of:</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KEq27hY.png" height="400">

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

- Fortunately, the _HTML5_ specification also included the ability to "upgrade" a HTTP connection upon request of the client.

- This connection upgrade results in the switch to a protocol that supports bidirectional communication - the **_websocket_** protocol.

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

- Working with _websockets_ natively is not terribly difficult, however, we've learned that using libraries such as jQuery can make us more productive developers.

- **socket.io** is a JavaScript library that wraps the _websocket_ protocol and makes it easier to implement the realtime, bidirectional communication we seek.

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
#### Basic Architecture

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y5EnZR3.png" width="800">

- <p>socket.io Clients & Servers send "messages" to each other...</p>

- and both Clients & Servers can listen and react to those "messages".

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
#### What are "messages"?
<br>

- _socket.io_ is all about sending and responding to **messages**.

- A **message** is a simple string identifier that **we** get to define,<br>for example:<br>`'login'`, or `'move-player'`

- Just like when naming functions, it's best to use identifiers for our messages that reflect their purpose.

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
#### What are "messages"? (cont.)
<br>

- When sending a message, we can optionally send data that will be received by the listeners for the message.  For example, when sending a `'login'` message, we might send the following JS object:

	```js
	{
		email: 'user@email.com',
		password: 'abc123'
	}
	```
 

---
### Intro to <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
#### Review Questions
<br>

<p style="text-align:left">Here's a few review questions before we take a look at our Starter App:</p>

- **Explain bidirectional communications.**

- **What protocol, introduced with _HTML5_, enables bidirectional communication between clients and server?**

- **Explain what "messages" are and what we do with them in _socket.io_.**

---
## Our Starter App<br><span style="text-transform:lowercase">realtime-circles</span>

---
### Our Starter App<span style="text-transform:lowercase">realtime-circles</span>

- Because you might deploy this app, please copy the `realtime-circles` starter code to your working directory.

- `$ npm install`

- `$ nodemon` and browse to `localhost:3000`

- Clicking creates a circle of random size and color.

- Our goal is to make this a realtime multi-player circle-fest!

- Let's review the starter code...

---
### Review the Code for <span style="text-transform:lowercase">realtime-circles</span>
<br>

- This is an Express app generated using `express-generator`.

- As a usual best practice in the land of the MERN-Stack,<br>`app.js` has been renamed to `server.js`.

- Examining `server.js` reveals that much of the default middleware has been removed - no problem because we're not going to be using cookies, parsing the body for posted data, etc.

---
### Review the Code for <span style="text-transform:lowercase">realtime-circles</span>
<br>

- We only have one view of interest - `index.ejs`. There will not be any full-page refreshes. <br>**What application architecture is this known as?**

- Near the bottom of `index.ejs`, we are loading our app's JavaScript file, `app.js`...

---
### Review the Code for <span style="text-transform:lowercase">realtime-circles</span>
<br>

- Reviewing `app.js` reveals that we are using _native_ JavaScript for DOM manipulation. Yay - no _jQuery_!

- `var circles` references a `<section>` that fills most of the rendered page.

- There's a click event listener on the `circles` element. This is where the action starts.

---
## Setting up <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>
<br>

#### Both the client and server<br>need to be configured with <span style="text-transform:lowercase">socket.io</span>

---
## Configure the Server

---
### Configure the Server
<br>

- To use _socket.io_, we first need to install its module:

	```sh
	$ npm install socket.io
	```

- No, the dot in the name is not a typo, it's legit.

- We're going to be writing some server-side code pertaining to using _socket.io_.<br>**Should we put this new code in our _server.js_ file, or is there a better practice?**

---
### Configure the Server (cont.)
<br>

- We don't want to unnecessarily clutter _server.js_, so we're going to put our _socket.io_ related code in a separate module file.

- Let's create a file named `io.js` in our project's root folder:

	```sh
	$ touch io.js
	```

---
### Configure the Server (cont.)
<br>

- _socket.io_, needs to "attach" to the _http server_, not the Express app.

- In an Express app scaffolded using `express-generator`, the _http server_ lives inside of the `/bin/www` file, so that is where we will require our new `io.js` module and attach to the _http server_:

	```js
	// inside bin/www
	var server = http.createServer(app);
	
	// load and attach socket.io to http server
	var io = require('../io');
	io.attach(server);
	```

---
### Configure the Server (cont.)
<br>

- Now we need to put some code in our `io.js` module. For now let's put some test code in it to make sure things are loading correctly:

	```js
	// io.js
	
	var io = require('socket.io')();
	
	// Listen for new connections from clients (socket)
	io.on('connection', function (socket) {
	  console.log('Client connected to socket.io!');
  	});
	
	// io represents socket.io on the server - let's export it
	module.exports = io;
	```

---
### Configure the Server (cont.)
<br>

- Check that `nodemon` is running our app without errors.

- No errors? Congrats the server is configured - time to configure the client!

---
## Configuring the Client<br><small>(Browser)</small>

---
### Configure the Client
<br>

- It takes quite a bit of JavaScript in the browser to connect to _socket.io_ on the server and implement all of its goodness.

- Lucky for us, the _socket.io_ module on the server helps us out by creating a secret route that returns dynamically generated JavaScript for the client - hassle free!

- The code returned to the browser is pre-configured with the server's info, etc.

---
### Configure the Client (cont.)
<br>

- All we need to do is load this special client configuration script in our `index.ejs`:

	```html
		...
		// special route created by socket.io on the server
    	<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    	<script src="/javascripts/app.js"></script>
    </body>
	```

- Be sure to load it before `app.js`.

- Refresh the browser and make sure there are no errors in the console.

---
### Configure the Client (cont.)
<br>

- The `socket.io.js` client script exposes an `io` global function that we call to obtain our connection to the server.

- Let's call it and assign the returned connection object to a variable named `socket`.

	```js
	// get our connection to the socket.io server
	var socket = io();
	console.log(socket);

	...
	```     

---
#### Congrats, the client and server<br>have both been configured!
<br>

<p>But are we still error free?<br>Let's check...</p>

---
### Test the Configuration
<br>

- Refresh the browser and verify that:
  
  - The `socket` object logged in the browser's console has a<br>`connected: true` property.
  
  - The server's terminal window logged out the message<br>"Client connected to socket.io!".

---
## Displaying Circles in Realtime

---
### Our Realtime Requirements
<br>

- We are going to code along to transform the app into a realtime<br>multi-player circle-fest that:

  -  Displays circles created by all players in realtime.

  -  Clears all circles from all connected browsers when the `clear` button is clicked (a practice exercise).

---
### Code Logic - Server
<br>

<p style="text-align:left">To accomplish our requirements, this is what we will need to do on the server:</p>

1. Listen for `add-circle` messages being sent from the clients.

2. When an `add-circle` message is received, forward (`emit`) it (along with the data received with the message) to all connected clients (including the client that sent the message to begin with).

---
### Code Logic - Client

<p style="text-align:left">To accomplish our requirements, this is what we will need to do on the client:</p>

1. Listen for `add-circle` messages from the server.<br>**Where will the message have originated from?**

2. When the `add-circle` message is received, it will contain a data object with the properties necessary to pass to the existing `addCircle()` function that creates circles!

3. In the existing click handler, emit the `add-circle` message to the server, passing along an object containing the `initials`, `x`, `y`, `dia` and `rgba` properties.

---
### Messages - Review 
<br>

- The `add-circle` message is a custom event message that we "defined" based upon what made sense for this application.

- **How many custom event messages can we define?**.

- As already noted, each message can be emitted with data. The data can be any type except for a function. Objects and arrays come in handy for sending complex rather than a single piece of primitive data.

---
## Displaying Circles - Server Code

---
### Displaying Circles - Server Code
<br>

- This code for _io.js_ will accomplish the goal for our code logic on the server:

	```js
	io.on('connection', function (socket) {
	  //new code below
	  socket.on('add-circle', function (data) {
	    io.emit('add-circle', data);
	  });
	});
	```

- Remember, `io` represents the server and `socket` the current client.

---
### Displaying Circles - Server Code
<br>

- With that code in place:

	- When a client (`socket`) connects to the server, we're using the **`on`** method to set up a listener on the server to listen to messages sent **from that client**.
	- When the server receives an `add-circle` message from the client, the callback function will send the same message to all clients using the server's (`io`) **`emit`** method.

---
## Displaying Circles - Client Code

---
### Displaying Circles - Client Code
<br>

- Listen for an `add-circle` message from the server in `app.js`:

	```js
	var socket = io();	
	// listen to the server for the `add-circle` event
	socket.on('add-circle', function (data) {
	  console.log(data);
	});
	```

- Here on the client (browser), we have the `socket` object representing our realtime connection to the server.

- For now, we're simply logging out data received from the server - baby steps :)

---
### Displaying Circles - Client Code (cont.)

- Now let's update the click event listener to emit an `add-circle` message to the server with the data:

	```js
	circles.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
	  // replace current line of code with this code
	  socket.emit('add-circle', {
	    initials: initials,
	    x: evt.clientX,
	    y: evt.clientY,
	    dia: randomBetween(10,100),
	    rgba: getRandomRGBA()
	  });
	});
	```

- **Our goal is for this message to be received by ________?**

---
### Displaying Circles - Messaging Check
<br>

<p style="text-align:left">To recap, our code so far:</p>

1. Emit's `add-circle` messages and data to the server when a user clicks.

2. Receives `add-circle` messages emitted from the server and console logs their data.

- <p>Let's open two browsers on <em>localhost:3000</em> and make sure our console shows the messages as we click!</p>

---
### Displaying Circles - Client Code (cont.)

<p style="text-align:left">Next, let's refactor <em>addCircle()</em> so that we can just pass in the data object received with the message:</p>

```js
// was -> function addCircle(x, y, dia, rgba) {
// updated to take advantage of ES2015's destructuring assignment
function addCircle({x, y, dia, rgba, initials}) {
  ...
}
```

- Using [ES2015's Destructuring Assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), we can pass in an object as an argument and that object's properties will be assigned to the listed variables.

- Note also that an `initials` variable is has been added to hold the user's initials that initiated the message. 

---
### Displaying Circles - Client Code (cont.)
<br>

- All that's left is to call the `addCircle()` function from our `socket.on` listener inside `app.js`:

	```js
	// listen to the server for the `add-circle` event
	socket.on('add-circle', function (data) {
	  // console.log(data);
	  addCircle(data);
	});
	```

- Use two browsers with different initials and test drive that sucka!

---

#### Now that we have our circles displaying in realtime<br>let's turn our attention to the next item on the roadmap - clearing the display!

---

### Clear All Circles<br>Practice (10 - 15 mins)
<br>

- Partner up and make the `clear` button clear all connected user's displays instead of just yours.

- Hints: This will require a new event message in addition to the `add-circle` event message.

---

### Who would like to come up and share their solution?

---
## Deploy to Heroku
<br>

<p>Set aside your fears and:<br></p>

1. Create a local git repo: `git init`
2. Add all files: `git add -A`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
4. Make sure you are logged in to Heroku: `heroku login`
5. Create a Heroku deployment: `heroku create`
6. Deploy your repo to Heroku: `git push heroku master`
7. Set app to use only one web dyno: `heroku ps:scale web=1` 
8. Once deployed, open the app: `heroku open`

---

## Realtime Is Fun!

---

## Questions
<br>

- **What is the name of the method used to send messages from the server/client to the client/server?**

- **What method is used to set up a listener for a message?**

- **What are the names of the event messages available to us?**

---

## More Big Fun? Track Players!
<br>

- In the realm of realtime, tracking connected users or players is know as tracking **presence**.

- It would be nice to know who's connected to our `realtime-circles` app, so let's do this!

---

### Track Players - Server Code Logic
<br>

1. When a client connects, set up a listener for a `register-player` message from that client. The client will send their initials as data with the message.<br><br>
2. When a client emits the `register-player` message, the server will:<br> (a) Add the player's `socket.id` and initials to a `players` object variable.<br> (b) Then we will then emit an `update-player-list` message, along with the updated list of initials, as an array, to all clients.<br><br>
3. When a client disconnects, we will remove the player from the `players` object and again, emit the `update-player-list` message.

---

### Track Players - Client Code Logic
<br>

1. After the player has entered their initials, emit the `register-player` message, sending the initials as data.

2. Listen for the `update-player-list` message and update the DOM by writing `<li>` tags (one for each player in the array) inside of the provided `<ul>`.

---

### Tracking Players - Server Code
<br>

- Define the `players` object to hold player's initials in `io.js`:

	```js
	var io = require('socket.io')();
	
	// object to hold player's initials as keys
	var players = {};
	```

---

### Tracking Players - Server Code (cont.)

<p style="text-align:left">Set up the listener for the <em>register-player</em> message in which we will take care of business:</p>

```js
io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  // new code below
  socket.on('register-player', function (initials) {
    // each socket has a unique id
    players[socket.id] = initials;
    io.emit('update-player-list', Object.values(players));
  });
... existing code below
```

<p style="text-align:left">Note that <strong>Object.values()</strong> is from ES2016/ES7</p>

---

### Tracking Players - Server Code (cont.)

- Set up the listener for when the player disconnects. Add this along with the other listeners:

	```js
	socket.on('disconnect', function () {
	  delete players[socket.id];
	  io.emit('update-player-list', Object.values(players));
	});
	... existing code below
	```
---

### Tracking Players - Client Code
<br>

<p style="text-align:left">After the player has entered their initials,<br>emit the <em>register-player</em> message, sending the initials<br>as data in <em>app.js</em>:</p>

```js
...
	
  do {
    initials = getInitials();
  } while (initials.length < 2 || initials.length > 3);
  // new code below
  socket.emit('register-player', initials);
	
...
	
```

---

### Tracking Players - Client Code (cont.)
<br>

<p style="text-align:left">Let's cache the players &lt;ul&gt; element into a var:</p>

```js
...
	
var circles = document.getElementById('circles');
  	
// players <ul> element in the footer
var players = document.getElementById('players');
	
...
```

---

### Tracking Players - Client Code

- Add the listener for the `update-player-list` event:
	
	```js
	...
		
	// listen for when the player list has changed
	socket.on('update-player-list', function (data) {
	  var playerList = '<li>' + data.join('</li><li>') + '</li>';
	  players.innerHTML = playerList;
	});
	 	
	...
	```

- Using the `join()` method to create a string from an array is very efficient!

---

## Tracking Players - Run It!

---

### Tracking Players - Summary
<br>

- When a player visits the page and enters their initials, the app informs the server by emitting the `register-player` message.

- The server adds the player's initials to the `players` object as a key and notifies all connected clients by emitting the `update-player-list` message.

- Clients then receive the `update-player-list` message, generate a nice list of `<li>` tags in a string, and blast that baby into the `<ul>`'s `innerHTML`.

--- 

## Further Study
<br>

- What we've created in this lesson is a single "channel" that all connected clients participate in.

- However, it is common to want separate channels dedicated to sub-groups of clients.

- _socket.io_ has two options for this use case: **rooms** & **namespaces**.

- If interested, here's a link to get you started: [socket.io Rooms & Namespaces](http://socket.io/docs/rooms-and-namespaces/)
