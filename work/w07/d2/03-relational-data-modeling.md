# Relational Data Design & Modeling

---
## Learning Objectives
<br>

Students will be able to:

- Identify the data **entities** for an application

- Identify **attributes** for a data entity

- Identify the **relationships** between data entities

- Understand the roles of **primary** and **foreign keys**

- Create an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for an application

---
## Data Modeling

---
### Data Modeling
<br>

- An important part of the planning process for an application is determining the data persistence needs of that application.

- This planning results in a **data model**.

- The **data model** is conceptual and is used as a blueprint for implementing the data persistence needs within a given database technology (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).

- The data model is typically visualized with an **Entity Relationship Diagram** (ERD).

---
## Data Entities

---
### What is a Data Entity?
<br>

- A **Data Entity**, or just **entity**, is used to conceptually model (represent) a real-world object within an application.

- Examples:  **User**, **Post**, **Comment**, **Order**, **Product**, etc.

- Each entity type will have one or more **attributes**...

---
### The Attributes for a Data Entity
<br>

- **Attributes** represent an entity's data. For example, a **Book** entity would probably have a **title** attribute.

- Each attribute has a data type. For example, _string_, _numeric_, _datetime_

#### Exercise (2 minutes)
<br>

- **Identify what other attributes a Book entity might have?** 

---
### Mapping Between an Entity<br>and a Relational Database

- Remember, the **conceptual data model** is used as a **blueprint** for how the actual database will be structured.

- Each **entity** in the data model identifies a **table** in the database. For example, a **Book** entity will result in a **books** table in the database.

- Each **attribute** in an entity identifies a **column** in the table.  For example, the **title** attribute will result in a column with the same name.

- Each **row** in the table is logically an **instance** of the **entity**.

---
## Designing an Entity Relationship Diagram

---
### The Application
<br>

- Let's design an ERD for a Concert Ticket tracking application.

- The application should track:
	- The tickets for a concert
	- The seat and price of the ticket
	- The date of the concert
	- The performer of the concert
	- The venue of the concert
	- The customer that bought a ticket

---
### The Process
<br>

- Reviewing an application's **user stories** is a good first step to creating the conceptual data model.

- There are three components that must be identified:
	1. The **data entities** (tables)
	2. The **attributes** (columns) for each entity
	3. The **relationships** between the entities.

- Since this application is supposed to track **tickets**, let's start with a preliminary **Ticket** entity...

---
### Identifying Data Entities
<br>

- Here's our first attempt at modeling the **Ticket** entity by including all the attributes you might see printed on a ticket:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jcpU8dF.png" height="400">

---
### Identifying Data Entities
<br>

- Now let's identify which attributes the **Ticket** entity currently has that should be their own entity.

- To do this, we can look for current attributes that:
	- Could have attributes of their own, e.g., a **Venue**. 
	- Or, be shared between other Tickets, again, a **Venue**.

---
### Identifying Data Entities
<br>

- To help with the following exercise, this is how the data might look like in the **tickets** table:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TSDHx6I.png">

- On to the exercise...

---
### Identifying Data Entities - Exercise
<br>

#### Pair up and analyze the preliminary Ticket entity.

#### The goal is to identify separate Data Entities and their attributes.

#### We will review your findings in 5 minutes.<br><br>Don't cheat by looking ahead ðŸ˜Š

---
### Database Normalization (Vocab)
<br>

- [Database Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) is a database design technique.

- A **relational** database is able to to perform searching & updating of data much more efficiently when it is "normalized".

- Okay, with the entities and their attributes set, let's talk about the third component of the ERD - **relationships** between the entities...

---
### Relationships Between Entities
<br>

- **Relationships** determine how the entities are related in terms of their **cardinality**.

- There are three main types of **cardinality**:
	- **one-to-one** (1:1)
	- **one-to-many** (1:M)
	- **many-to-many** (M:M)

- Let's take a look at each of these...

---
### One-To-One Relationships
<br>

- The **one-to-one** relationship exists when one row in a table is "linked" to one row in another table.

- Although **1:1** relationships are not as common as **1:M** and **M:M** relationships, they have their purpose.

- For example, a **Restaurant** entity in a large chain might have a **1:1** relationship with a **Region** entity that it belongs to.

- Let's see how we specify a one-to-one relationship in an ERD...

---
### One-To-One Example
<br>

- A **business** has one **mailing address** and vice-versa:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fTCHHpF.png" height="300">

- Let's discuss the connecting line and PK/FK stuff...

---
### ERD Cardinality Lines
<br>

- In an ERD, lines drawn between entities describe the cardinality between those entities as follows:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sEnNZyZ.png">

- Note that these are the three main types of cardinality. There are more specific versions of these, such as _zero or many_, as [shown here](https://imgur.com/JtPQEOO).

---
### Primary Keys
<br>

- But what are those **(PK)** and **(FK)** attribute annotations you ask?

- An attribute (column) annotated with **PK** designates the **Primary Key** for that entity (table).

- It is what uniquely identifies a row in a table.

- Although not as common, a **PK** can be a _composite key_, where two or more columns are combined and uniquely identify the a row.

---
### Foreign Keys
<br>

- An attribute (column) annotated with **FK** designates a **Foreign Key**.

- A **FK** provides the "link" to a **PK** in another table.

- Foreign Keys are what enable a database engine to efficiently join two tables that are related.

- It's **important** to note that foreign keys always exist on the **many** (child) side of a **1:M** relationship.  **Why would this be the case instead of the other way around?**

---
### Determining the Cardinality Between Tables

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4iq2IOu.png" height="450">

- Okay, back to modeling the relationships between the entities of the _ticket tracking_ application...
	
---
### Determining the Cardinality Between Tables
<br>

- As a note, to save screen space, the entities are not going to show attributes for the primary and foreign keys.

- However, be aware that as a default, primary keys are named `id` and foreign keys as `<parent_entity_name>_id`.

---
### Determining the Cardinality Between Tables

- Usually by focusing on two entities, [domain knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge) and common-sense will reveal the relationship (usually a<br>one-to-many or many-to-many)

- Beginning with **Concert** and **Ticket**<br>**What's the relationship?**

- Let's see how this is diagramed...

---
### Creating the ERD

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jlKmola.png" height="400">

- Reads as: **"A Concert has many Tickets"** and **"A Ticket belongs to a Concert"**.

- **Which of the two tables would have to contain the FK?**

---
### Creating the ERD
<br>

- Now for **Customer** and **Ticket**<br>**What's the relationship?**

---
### Creating the ERD

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Uc4wHF.png" height="400">

- Reads as: **"A Customer has many Tickets"** and **"A Ticket belongs to a Customer"**.

---
### Creating the ERD
<br><br>

#### Is there a relationship between the **Customer** and **Concert** entities? ...

---
### Creating the ERD
<br>

- Thanks to the way relational databases are designed, you can access other tables that are not directly joined by joining with others that are.

- For example, you most certainly could access all of the _concerts_ purchased by a _customer_ by joining through _tickets_.

- Although not shown on the ERD with a connecting line, you could say that **"A Customer has many Concerts through Tickets"**, as well as, **"A Concert has many Customers through Tickets"**.

---
### Creating the ERD - Exercise <small>(5 min)</small>
<br>

- As a pair exercise, please identify the remaining relationships:
	- **Concert** and **Venue**
	- **Concert** and **Performer**

- We'll review in 5 minutes... (don't peek)

---
### ERD - Final Version
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qz8V0NX.png" height="400">

- Note that **many-to-many** relationships, e.g., **Concert** and **Performer**, require a "hidden" join table to implement in the  database - **Why is this**?

---
## In Summary
<br>

- Modeling data is an important step during the planning of an application.  After all, _**data is the single source of truth**_!

- In addition to what we covered in this lesson, there are several other notations/ways to diagram an application's data model.  Check out [this post](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams) from _lucidchart.com's_ website for more info.
