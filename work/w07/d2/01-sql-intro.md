## Database Intro

### What is a Database?

The vast majority of applications manipulate and display data.

Early on, our programs held data in "memory" using data structures such as arrays and objects.  However, when the app was exited, any changes to the data were lost - databases avoid this...

Simply put, **a database provides permanent storage for data**.

### Different Types of Databases

[This site](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) ranks databases according to their popularity.

As you can see, there are several different types of databases and several "brands" within each type.

Most database technologies can be broken down into two main categories:

- Relational databases
- NoSQL databases

Relational databases are by far the most popular type of database technology. Conceived by [E.F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd) while working for IBM back in 1970.

In SEI, we'll be using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)  since it's arguably the best open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) available.

### Anotomy of a Relational Database

#### Schema

The structure of a particular database is known as its **schema**.

Schemas include the definition of such things as the database's:

- Tables, including the number and data type of each column
- Indexes for efficient access of data
- Constraints (rules, such as whether a field can be null or not)

#### Tables 

The primary container for data in a relational database is a **table**:

As you can see, database tables look a lot like a spreadsheet since they consist of columns and rows.

Tables are also known as _relations_, thus the term _relational database_.

A single table in a relational database holds data for a particular _data entity_, for example, **customers**, **orders**, **reviews**, etc.

Since only one type of data entity can be held in a single table, related data, for example, the **songs** for an **artist**, are stored in separate tables and "linked" via what is known as a **foreign key (FK)**:

TABLE: **artists**

| id (PK)       | name           | nationality |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1        | Prince         | American    |
| 2        | Sir Elton John | British     |

TABLE: **songs**

| id (PK)    | name                | year_released | artist_id (FK) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1      | Tiny Dancer         | 1971          | 2         |
| 2      | Little Red Corvette | 1982          | 1         |
| 3      | Raspberry Beret     | 1985          | 1         |
| 4      | Your Song           | 1970          | 2         |

Note that foreign key fields hold the value of its parent's **primary key (PK)**.

The naming convention is typically snake-cased and always plural.

#### Columns (Fields)

The columns of a table have a:

- Name
- Data type
- Optional contraints

The typical naming convention is usually snake-cased and singular.

PostgreSQL has [many data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype.html) for columns, but common ones include:

- integer
- decimal
- varchar (variable-length strings)
- text (unlimited length strings)
- date (does not include time)
- timestamp (both date and time)
- boolean

Common constraints for a column include:

- `PRIMARY KEY`: column, or group of columns, uniquely identify a row
- `REFERENCES` (Foreign Key): value in column must match the primary key in another table 
- `NOT NULL`: column must have a value, it cannot be empty (null)
- `UNIQUE`: data in this column must be unique among all rows in the table

#### Rows (Records / Tuples)

A row in a table represents a single instance of the data entity.

For example a particular **artist** in the **artists** table.

### ‚ùì Database Review Questions

1. **A __________ defines the structure of a particular database.**

2. **A table in a database consists of __________ & __________.**

3. **A __________ key uniquely identifies a row within a table.**

4. **A __________ key references the primary key in a different table.**

## SQL

### What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**, typically pronounced "sequel", is a programming language used to CRUD data stored in a relational database.

SQL syntax is similar to the English language.

Although SQL is fairly standard, it can vary from depending on the particular RDBMS. For example, the _SQLite_ RDBMS has a minimal implementation of SQL commands.

### The `psql` Interactive Terminal

There are [several GUI tools available](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Community_Guide_to_PostgreSQL_GUI_Tools) for working with PostgreSQL, however, in SEI we won't need one because we'll mostly be accessing the database using Python/Django and it's better to learn SQL commands in terminal.

`psql` is a tool that runs in terminal and allows us to work with PostgreSQL databases by typing in commands. It was installed with PostgreSQL.

Open a terminal session and type: `psql`.

You'll see your PostreSQL version and psql's prompt:

```
$ psql
psql (9.6.3)
Type "help" for help.

jimclark=#
```

Here are some useful commands (note the use of a **backslash**):

```sql
help -- general help
\?   -- help with psql commands
\h   -- help with SQL commands
\l   -- Lists all databases
\q   -- exits psql
q    -- exits a psql list or dialogue
```

### Creating a Database and a Table

Let's create a database named `music` and a `bands` table:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE music; -- Don't forget the semicolon!

\l -- What changed?

\c music -- Connect to the music database

\d -- Lists all tables

-- Define a table's schema
CREATE TABLE bands (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,  -- serial is auto-incrementing integer
  name varchar NOT NULL,
  genre varchar
);

\d -- There should now be a bands table
```

The backslash commands, e.g. `\d`, are psql commands.

The `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` are SQL commands.

### Basic Querying and Inserting Data

Now let's write some more SQL to query (`SELECT`) and create data (`INSERT INTO`):

```sql
SELECT * FROM bands; -- The * represents all fields

-- For text, use single quotes, not double
INSERT INTO bands (name) VALUES ('The Smiths');

INSERT INTO bands (name, genre) VALUES ('Rush', 'prog rock');

SELECT * FROM bands; -- Use the up arrow to access previous commands
```

Because the type of `id` is set to `serial`, the RDBMS automatically assigns it.

### Creating a Table for a Related Data Entity

Let's say we have the following data relationship:  `Band ---< Musisican`

_A Band has many Musicians_ and _a Musician belongs to a Band_

Whenever you have a one:many relationship, the rows in the table for the many-side must include a column that references which row in the table on the one-side it _belongs to_.

This column is known as a **foreign key (FK)**.

The FK must be of the same data type is the primary key in the parent table - usually an **integer**.

Here's how we could define the `musicians` table:

```sql
-- REFERENCES creates a FK constraint
CREATE TABLE musicians (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar NOT NULL,
  quote text,
  band_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES bands (id)
);

\d musicians -- details for table
```

Now let's attempt to add a musician with a bogus foreign key:

```sql
INSERT INTO musicians (name, band_id) VALUES ('Geddy Lee', 999);

-- Let's try again, but first, we need the id of the band
SELECT * FROM bands;

-- Assuming 'Rush' has an id of 2
INSERT INTO musicians (name, band_id) VALUES ('Geddy Lee', 2);

SELECT * FROM musicians;  -- There's Geddy!

-- Now let's add Neil
-- Use two single quotes to embed a single quote
INSERT INTO musicians (name, quote, band_id)
VALUES (
'Neil Peart',
'If you''ve got a problem, take it out on a drum',
2);
```

### Querying Data using a `JOIN` Clause

The `JOIN` clause is used with a `SELECT` to query for data from more than one table.

Let's query for all of the bands with their musicians:

```sql
-- table right of JOIN has the FKs
SELECT * FROM bands JOIN musicians ON bands.id = musicians.band_id;
```

Note that no records are returned for bands without any musicians. This is called an **INNER JOIN**, which is the default.

There are several types of [joins](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-joins/).

If we want to return all bands, regardless of whether or not there's any matches for musicians, we use whats called a `LEFT JOIN`:

```sql
-- Using aliases for the table names
SELECT *
FROM bands b
LEFT JOIN musicians m ON b.id = m.band_id;
```

### Querying Data using a `WHERE` Clause

The [WHERE clause](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-where/) allows selecting records that meet a condition or conditions:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM bands b
LEFT JOIN musicians m ON b.id = m.band_id
WHERE b.name = 'Rush' AND m.name LIKE 'G%';
```

The `LIKE` operator uses:

- `%` to match any number of characters
- `_` to match a single character

Conditions can be based on any column:

```sql
SELECT * FROM musicians WHERE id > 1;
```

### Updating Data

Time to give Geddy a quote by using the SQL `UPDATE` command:

```sql
UPDATE musicians
SET quote = 'I love to write, it''s my first love.'
WHERE name = 'Geddy Lee';
```

### Deleting Data

Be careful with this command because if you don't use a `WHERE` clause, you can accidentally delete all of the data from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bands;

DELETE FROM bands WHERE name LIKE '%Smiths';

SELECT * FROM bands;
```

### SQL - Summary

As much fun as it is to write SQL, most developers don't have many opportunities to do so because they use software known as an _Object Relational Mapper (ORM)_ to automatically write SQL and communicate with the database server.

Regardless, having an understanding of SQL always looks good on a resume!
