# Explore Markdown - After Hours

---

## Intro

For this after hours you will get to practice researching and learning _markdown_.

_Markdown_ is a simple markup language that uses plain text characters for formatting.  For example, text between asterisk (`*`) characters is italicized and the `#` character is used to format lines as headings.

Typically, _markdown_ is converted by applications into HTML and often allows the embedding of pure HTML within a markdown document. 

In WDI, the lessons will usually written in _markdown_.

You will use _markdown_ to write README files which are used to document your projects.


## Assignment

1. Research how to use the _Markdown_ language

2. Install a _Markdown_ editor/viewer

### Research

Here are a few links that will help you learn _Markdown_:

- [GitHub Guide - Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

- [Markdown Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/)

### Install a _Markdown_ Editor

For editing and viewing _Markdown_, use VS Code or a dedicated markdown editor such as [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)

### Create a Cheatsheet for Bash Commands

Although you can find numerous cheatsheets for Bash (Terminal) commands, why not create your own using markdown to get some practice with it?

Note that a cheatsheet need not be an exhaustive reference - so feel free to exclude commands that are used infrequently.
