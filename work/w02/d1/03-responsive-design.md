## Intro to Responsive Web Design

### Background

Not that long ago, building a successful online presence meant just ensuring that your website worked correctly in all the major desktop browsers. 

Fast forward to today and desktop browsing is rapidly being replaced by surfing on mobile devices.

Approximately 80% percent of Americans now own a smartphone and well over 50% of web pages are served to smartphones **globally**!

Web sites and applications designed just for desktop displays don't cut it anymore!

### Enter - Responsive Web Design

**Responsive Web Design**, not surprisingly, is designing a web page to respond to the size of the device's screen being used to view it.

Specifically, the most important criteria to respond to is the **width** of the device's screen.

Lastly, what specifically **responds**? Primarily, the overall layout of the page, but you can pretty much change anything on the page you want.  For example, I'm sure you've seen the menu links in a navigation bar disappear and be replaced with a "hamburger" icon before.  Take a look at the image at the top of this lesson too - notice how the number of columns changes?

Okay, now that you know what Responsive Design is, let's look at some real-world examples out there.


## Examples of Responsive Design

One great example of a responsive site is one you've become very familiar with: [GitHub](https://github.com/).

For another great example is [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/), which is a fantastic site dedicated to web design:

## Mobile First Design Philosophy

There are two approaches that can be followed:

1. Write the starting CSS for a large, desktop screen, then apply "new" CSS (using media queries) as the screen width decreases, or
2. Write the starting CSS for a mobile screen, then apply additional CSS as the width increases.

The experts tell us that it's better, to use a **mobile first** approach for the following reasons:

- Translating the design from mobile to desktop is easier than vice-versa, thus it should require less time to build the site.
- Mobile first encourages you to think about what content is the most important - and prioritize them.
- It's easier to detect performance related issues, such as the slow loading of large image files, on mobile devices and it's better to deal with performance issues early on.
- A design based on a small screen width, although not ideal, is usable on larger devices, however the reverse is often not the case.

## First Step to Enabling a Better Experience on Mobile

For those of use that remember using smartphones when they first came out to browse the web, we often saw screens with tiny, unreadable content like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BXhiZRF.jpg">

Unlike on desktop browsers that render pixel-by-pixel, mobile browsers actually render to a virtual **viewport**. This virtual viewport concept is what enables pinching to zoom in and out.

By default, mobile browsers scale down the content to fit it in the browser window, resulting in tiny text that's hard to read.

#### `<meta name="viewport" ...>` to the Rescue

The viewport `meta` tag was created to fix the above problem by informing the browser not to scale the page down and display it based upon the physical number of pixels available - just like desktop browsers do.

This viewport `meta` tag is so important, that VS Code has been adding it automatically in the HTML boilerplate.

The following should look familiar...

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

With that `meta` tag in the document's `head` element, the above page will now render as:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hdSBUzg.jpg">

Much better!  Be sure to always have `<meta name="viewport" ...>` in every web app you write!

## Set Up

To experiment with responsive design, open up a new HTML, CSS, JS Repl in [repl.it](https://repl.it) and name it **Media Queries**.

Copy/paste the following HTML inside of the `<body>`:

```html
<header>MEDIA QUERIES</header>
<aside>SIDE</aside>
<main>CONTENT</main>
<footer>FOOTER</footer>
```

In addition, copy/paste the following CSS into _style.css_:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Helvetica;
  display: grid;
  /* mobile first - single column */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 30px auto 100px;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "hdr"
    "ftr"
    "content"
    "side";
}

header {
  grid-area: hdr;
  background-color: #ff9e7a;
}

footer {
  grid-area: ftr;
  background-color: #b1fcc8;
}

aside {
  grid-area: side;
  background-color: #ffe07a;
}

main {
  grid-area: content;
  background-color: #bf9df7;
}

header, footer, aside, main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

In the earlier lesson you saw how to position **grid items** using the `grid-column` property.

As you can see, using [grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) is very powerful!

## Using Media Queries to Apply Different CSS Rules to a Page

#### What's a Media Query?

A [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) provides a way to conditionally add CSS rules.

A media query contains its own section of CSS that is used to modify the "base" CSS when certain "media" conditions exist.

The media query can be composed of any number of _media feature expressions_ and an optional _media type_, such as `print`, `screen`, or `all`.

#### Our First Media Query

Since we're interested in conditionally adding CSS as the screen increases in width, our first media query might look like this:

```css
/* 768px is a common "breakpoint" width for tablets */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
	body {
	  /* tablet - two column display */
	  grid-template-columns: 1fr 4fr;
	  grid-template-rows: 50px auto 30px;
	  grid-template-areas: 
	    "hdr hdr"
	    "side content"
	    "ftr ftr";
	}
}
```

Note that we only add CSS for what we need to change - there's no reason to repeat any of the CSS above the media query.

Resize the window and check it out!

There's a link in the references section you can use to start to learn more about media queries.

Next up is a lab that will give you some practice working with **Media Queries**, **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.

But, here's a quickie for you...

## Essential Questions

1. **In your own words, describe Responsive Design.**

2. **When coding an app that we want to make responsive, is it more common to write the "base" CSS for mobile screens or desktop?**

3. **What key CSS feature did we just learn about that's fundamental to the implementation of responsive design?**


## Practice

Adding another media query for another breakpoint at `(min-width: 1024px)`, a common breakpoint width for desktop displays.

Within the query, add some CSS to change colors of the backgrounds and/or text.
