# Responsive Design - Lab

## Intro

Time for some practice implementing a mobile first responsive design!

## Deliverable

This lab **is a deliverable** - please complete it and slack your instructor the link to the Repl when you are done.

## Lab

The goal of this lab is to reproduce the `Smashing Magazine` website!

- Your app should be a **mobile first** design, which means your base CSS will:
	- Layout those pretty red "cards" in a single column
	- Show a minimal header:

- Add a media query with a breakpoint at `768px` that:
	- Lays out a two column design.
	- Renders a full nav bar as shown up above.

- Get as close as you can - but it does not have to be perfect!


## Set Up

Please create an HTML, CSS, JS Repl and name it `Responsive Design Lab`.

## Hints

- Be sure to start with a bit of CSS reset:

	```css
		* {
		  box-sizing: border-box;
		}
		
		body {
		  margin: 0;
		  font-family: Helvetica;
		}
	```
	
- Do not use the `grid-template-areas` approach for defining a layout with an unknown number of rows.  For example, if you make the `<body>` a CSS Grid with a header, main (center area), and footer - this is always three rows, so using `grid-template-areas` is fine. However, make that main center area itself a CSS Grid and use just the `grid-template-columns` property to allow for any number of "tiles" to automatically be placed in the grid.

- Use the _Digital Color Meter_ application that comes with the Mac to "pick" the colors from the screen.

- Use the DevTools to inspect the elements and styling to how Smashing Magazine built the site.

- Checkout how you can use DevTools to check out the responsiveness of the app!

### Collaborate and have fun!

## Bonus

Go for a second breakpoint to implement a 3-column layout!
