# Build Another Game - Rock Paper Scissors

## Intro

Before heading off to start work on your Project 1, let's write another browser-based game together from start to finish (hopefully).

We'll get practice building the the UI using HTML & CSS and coding the game-play with JavaScript.

Also, we'll follow a MVC, data-centric approach as described in the [Guide on How to Build a Browser Game](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/6f1919291f6007b2c0b2c93d925d6bac).

## Wireframes

We're going to go with a clean, minimalistic user interface.

> Note: Feel free to go with your own layout, colors, etc. as we code this app.

Upon loading, the UI should look something like the following wireframe:

Upon clicking the **Rock, Paper, Scissors... Go!** button, there will be a small display that counts down 3, 2, 1...:

After the countdown finishes, the scores will be updated; and if there's a winner, that symbol will be rendered with a grey border.

## Setup

Included along side this README file are starter versions of the `index.html`, `css/main.css`, `js/main.js`; along with an `imgs` folder containing the three RPS images.

Feel free to modify these files directly where they live in the class repo.  However, if you want to save this project as a separate repo in your GitHub, copy the `starter-code` folder out of the class repo  so that you don't end up creating a nested repo.  If you do copy the folder, you may rename it something like `rock-paper-scissors`.

## Code away and have fun!

#### This exercise is not a deliverable.
