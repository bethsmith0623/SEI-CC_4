---

### <span style="text-transform:lowercase">express-generator</span>

---
#### <span style="text-transform:lowercase">express-generator</span>
<br>

- Okay, so we've had big fun getting an Express app up and running from scratch.

- We defined some basic routes and rendered a couple of views using the EJS view engine.

- Later today we're going to learn about middleware and see how we can create and update data.

---
#### <span style="text-transform:lowercase">express-generator</span>
<br>

- In this lesson, the first thing we'll take a look at is a popular tool - `express-generator`.

- `express-generator` creates a "skeleton" Express app that:
	- Separates the HTTP server code from our web app's logic.
	- Has best practice routing implemented.
	- Is configured to serve static assets from a `public` folder.
	- If we specify it, will configure the EJS view engine.
	- Has error handling configured.
	- Has key middleware configured and mounted by default.
 
---
#### <span style="text-transform:lowercase">express-generator</span>
<br>

- Let's install it:

	```sh
	$ npm install -g express-generator
	```

- `express-generator` is a CLI that can be run from anywhere, that's why we install it using the global `-g` flag.

---
#### <span style="text-transform:lowercase">express-generator</span>

Let's take a look at the options available to us

```sh
$ express -h

Usage: express [options] [dir]
	
	
Options:
	
    --version        output the version number
-e, --ejs            add ejs engine support
    --pug            add pug engine support
    --hbs            add handlebars engine support
-H, --hogan          add hogan.js engine support
-v, --view <engine>  add view <engine> support (dust|ejs|hbs|hjs|jade|pug|twig|vash) (defaults to jade)
    --no-view        use static html instead of view engine
-c, --css <engine>   add stylesheet <engine> support (less|stylus|compass|sass) (defaults to plain css)
    --git            add .gitignore
-f, --force          force on non-empty directory
-h, --help           output usage information
```    

---
#### Generating Our App's Skeleton with<br><span style="text-transform:lowercase">express-generator</span>
<br>

- We will use the `-e` option to use the __ejs__ template engine instead of __pug__ (the default).

- From your new app's parent directory:

	```sh
	$ express -e express-todos
	$ cd express-todos
	```

- We then install the **node modules** that are listed in the `package.json`:

	```sh
	$ npm i
	```

---
#### Folder Structure

- Our scaffolded folder structure will look like this:

	```sh
	├── app.js
	├── bin
	│   └── www
	├── package.json
	├── public
	│   ├── images
	│   ├── javascripts
	│   └── stylesheets
	│       └── style.css
	├── routes
	│   ├── index.js
	│   └── users.js
	└── views
	    ├── error.js
	    └── index.js
	```

- Let's explore the above structure in our text editor...

---
#### Starting the Application
<br>

- One option to start the server is to type `npm start`. This will execute the start script specified in *package.json*. However, it doesn't restart the app when there's changes...

- `nodemon` is still our best option and we can now just type `nodemon` which will use that same `start` script.

---
#### Starting the Application

- Browsing to `localhost:3000` greets us with:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kHXF4Qg.png">

---
#### Renaming <span style="text-transform:lowercase">app.js</span>
<br>

- MERN/MEAN Stack apps often have a client-side file named `app.js` and this could get confusing having two `app.js` files. This is why many developers name their main Express file `server.js`.

- So let's rename it...

---
#### Renaming <span style="text-transform:lowercase">app.js</span>
<br>

- First, rename `app.js` to `server.js`.

- Then, inside of `bin/www`, change line 7 from:

	```js
	var app = require('../app');
	```
	
	to:
	
	```js
	var app = require('../server');
	```

- That's it, however, you might need to restart `nodemon`.

---
### MVC Code Organization

---
#### MVC Code Organization
<br>

- Model-View-Controller (MVC) has been a proven approach for successfully organizing code for decades.

- In fact, many web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.net, Spring MVC (Java), and others implement the MVC architectural pattern.

- Express on the other hand, just like it states on its landing page, is _unopinionated_.  That means we are free to structure and organize our Express apps anyway we please.

---
#### MVC Code Organization
<br>

- However, since MVC is a proven pattern that works, most Express developers use MVC to organize their Express applications - so we will too :)

- Express generator has already organized the view templates into a `views` folder. 

- Let's make folders to hold our models and controllers:

	```sh
	$ mkdir models controllers
	```

---
### Best Practice Routing

---
#### Best Practice Routing
<br>

- In our `first-express` app, we used the `app.get` method to define routes.

- Although it works, the better practice is to:
	- Use Express `router` objects to organize related routes, for example, routes dedicated to a data resource such as `todos`.
	- Create each `router` in its own module from which it is exported.
	- `require` the exported `router` inside of **server.js**.
	- Mount the `router` object in the request pipeline (`route` objects are also middleware functions).

---
#### Best Practice Routing
<br>

- The `Router` objects can provide more flexible and powerful routing in complex apps.

- `Router` objects are actually mini-Express apps! They can even have their own middleware.

---
#### Best Practice Routing
<br>

- As an example of using this better approach to routing, let's look at how `express-generator` sets up routing...

- First, there's a `routes` folder containing two router modules:
	- **index.js**: Great for defining general purpose routes, e.g., the root route.
	- **users.js**: An example of a router dedicated to a _resource_, in this case, _users_. 

---
#### The Express <em>Router</em> Object
<br>

- Note how routes are defined on those two `router` objects using a `get` method just like we did with `app`:<br>`router.get()` instead of `app.get()`

- Each `router` object has one route defined - compare those two routes, notice the _method_ and the _paths_?  They're the same - isn't that a problem?  Not in this case...

---
#### The Express <em>Router</em> Object
<br>

- The two route modules are required on lines 7 & 8 of `server.js`.

- Lastly, the routers are mounted in the middleware pipeline with the `app.use` method on lines 22 & 23:

	```js
	app.use('/', indexRouter);
	app.use('/users', usersRouter);
	```

- It's **important** to realize that the path in `app.use` is **combined** with the path specified on the router objects...

---
#### The Express <em>Router</em> Object
<br>

- Let's say you have a `router` object that defines a route like this:

	```js
	router.get('/', function(req, res) {...
	```
	
	and mounted like this:
	
	```js
	app.use('/todos', todoRouter);
	```
	**What is the actual path of the route?**

---
#### The Express <em>Router</em> Object
<br>

- Another example, let's say you have a `router` object that defines a route like this:

	```js
	router.get('/today', function(req, res) {...
	```
	
	and mounted like this:
	
	```js
	app.use('/calendar', calendarRouter);
	```
	**What is the actual path of that route?**

---
#### To-Do Refactor
<br>

- We're going refactor the To-Do code from yesterday to follow best practices...

- We'll copy over the **index.ejs** view and put the todos "database" into the `models` folder.

- Then we'll incorporate best-practice routing.

- Finally, after learning about how to organize code into _controllers_, well, that's what we'll do.

---
#### To-Do Refactor - <span style="text-transform:lowercase">index.ejs</span>
<br>

- Create **todos/index.ejs**:

	```sh
	$ mkdir views/todos
	$ touch views/todos/index.ejs
	```

- Add the HTML boilerplate.

- Update the title to: `<title>Express To-Do</title>`

---
#### To-Do Refactor - <span style="text-transform:lowercase">index.ejs</span>
<br>

- Here's the EJS from yesterday to copy/paste:

	```html
	 <body>
	   <h1>Todos</h1>
	   <ul>
	     <% todos.forEach(function(t) { %>
	       <li>
	         <%= t.todo %>
	           - 
	         <%= t.done ? 'done' : 'not done' %>
	       </li>
	     <% }); %>
	   </ul>
	 </body>
	```

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Todo Model
<br>

- Now let's create and copy over our model.

- Create **models/todo.js**:

	```sh
	$ touch models/todo.js
	```

- Note that modules for _models_ should be named singularly.

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Todo Model
<br>

- Here's the code from yesterday, just slightly refactored:

	```js
	const todos = [
	  {todo: 'Feed Dogs', done: true},
	  {todo: 'Learn Express', done: false},
	  {todo: 'Buy Milk', done: false}
	];
	
	module.exports = {
	  getAll
	};
	
	function getAll() {
	  return todos;
	}
	```

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Routing
<br>

- For routing, first let's rename the **routes/users.js** route module to a name that's more appropriate for our resource - **routes/todos.js**.

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Routing
<br>

- The renaming of **routes/users.js** to **routes/todos.js** requires a couple of changes in **server.js**; both when the router module is being _required_, and when it's being _mounted_:

	```js
	// around line 8
	var todosRouter = require('./routes/todos');
	```
	and
	
	```js
	// around line 23
	app.use('/todos', todosRouter);
	```

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Routing
<br>

- The following is the **index** route code for the to-dos we used yesterday.

- Copy it into **routes/todos.js** below the existing route and then we'll refactor it:

	```js
	// existing route above
	
	app.get('/todos', function(req, res) {
	  res.render('todos/index', {
	    todos: todoDb.getAll()
	  });
	});
	```

- Now for the refactor...

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Routing
<br>

- We'll delete that existing route in a moment, but first note its **path**...<br>**Why is it only a forward slash?**

- Okay, update our route's path to `/` and delete the existing route.

- Notice how we're calling `todoDb.getAll()` - this will currently cause an error...

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Routing
<br>

- We first need to require the Todo model as follows:

	```js
	var router = express.Router();
	// require the Todo model
	var Todo = require('../models/todo');
	```

- It's convention to name model variables singularly and with upper-camel-casing.

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Routing
<br>

- With the model required, **what do we need to change on this line of code?**

	```js
	todos: todoDb.getAll()
	```

- Let's do it!

---
#### To-Do Refactor - Routing
<br>

- There's another change that need to be made<br>**does anybody see it?**

- Hint: What's that `app` object doing there?

---
#### To-Do Refactor
<br>

- With the refactor complete, browsing to `localhost:3000/todos` should render the to-dos just like yesterday!

- Hey, let's add a link on **views/index.ejs** so that we can click it to see the to-dos instead of navigating via the address bar...

---
#### To-Do Refactor
<br>

- In **views/index.ejs**:

	```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	  <head>
	    <title><%= title %></title>
	    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    <h1><%= title %></h1>
	    <a href="/todos">To-Do List</a>
	  </body>
	</html>
	```

- For styling, let's copy that `<link>` over to **todos/index.ejs** and...

---
#### To-Do Refactor
<br>

- In **routes/index.js**, fix the value of the `title` property being passed to the view:

	```js
	res.render('index', { title: 'Express To-Do' });
	```

- That's better.

- On to **controllers**...

---
### Controllers
<br>

---
#### Controllers
<br>

- In a web application that follows the MVC architectural pattern, **controllers**:
	- Use Models to perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update & delete) data operations.
	- Implement any additional application logic, often relying on other services and utility modules; and
	- Pass data to Views to be rendered then return the resulting markup to the browser.

- FYI, the above description is gold if asked about MVC in an interview :)

---
#### Controllers
<br>

- Controllers are functions, but wait, we already wrote functions that perform those responsibilities in our route modules!

- Exactly!  Those functions _are_ controllers, we just need to separate our concerns, i.e., we need to separate the **route definitions** from their respective **controller functions**.

---
#### Controllers
<br>

- Let's start by creating a controller module for the _todos_ resource:

	```sh
	$ touch controllers/todos.js
	```

- Let's copy **just the function part** of the following route definition:

	```js
	router.get('/', function(req, res) {
	  res.render('todos/index', {
	    todos: Todo.getAll()
	  });
	});
	```
	
- Paste that function inside of **controllers/todos.js**...

---
#### Controllers

- Let's export the `index` controller method (also know as a controller _action_)...

- The pasted and fixed up code should look like:

	```js
	module.exports = {
	  index
	};
	
	function index(req, res) {
	  res.render('todos/index', {
	    todos: Todo.getAll()
	  });
	}
	```

- The above is a good approach to follow when it comes to exporting functionality.

---
#### Controllers
<br>

- The router no longer needs the `Todo` model.

- But, the controller does! Let's go cut it from **routes/todos.js** and paste it at the top of **controllers/todos.js**:

	```js
	var Todo = require('../models/todo');
	```

---
#### Controllers
<br>

- Back in **routes/todos.js**, we need to require the controller in order to have access to its actions (methods):

	```js
	var todosCtrl = require('../controllers/todos');
	```

- Now, the refactor:

	```js
	router.get('/', todosCtrl.index);
	```
	How clean is that?!?!

- Refresh and everything should be hunky-dory!

---
### MVC Organization Revisited

---
#### MVC Organization Revisited
<br>

- Notice how we now have the following for the **_todos_ resource**:
	- **models/todo.js**
	- **views/todos**
	- **controllers/todos.js**
	- **routes/todos.js**

- Each data _resource_ will likely receive the same treatment.

- Note that resource names are pluralized except for the model.

---
### URL/Route Parameters

---
#### URL/Route Parameters
<br>

- In our web apps, we will often need to pass information, such as an identifier for a certain data resource, in the **path** of the HTTP request.

- **URL Parameters**, also known as **Route Parameters**, just like parameters in functions, provide a way for data to be passed in to the router & controller via the URL of the request.

- Let's look at this analogy...

---
#### URL/Route Parameters
<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X8Cj85b.png">

---
#### URL/Route Parameters
<br>

- In Express, we define route parameters in the path string using a colon, followed by the parameter name.

- Let's say we want to view a details page for a resource.

- Just like we refer to the **index** route/action to list all of a resource, we will refer to the **show** route/action when displaying the details of a single resource.

- Let's add the functionality to view a single To Do...

---
### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
 
---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- When adding functionality to your apps, start by identifying what route makes sense - this is usually based on [RESTful/Resourceful Routing conventions](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6).

- We'll definitely be reviewing RESTful/Resourceful Routing later, in fact we just might quiz you on it one day - it's that important :)

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- According to REST, the "correct" route to display a<br>single To Do would be:

	```sh
	GET /todos/:id
	```

- With the proper route identified, the next step is to create UI that will send request(s) that match that route...

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- Let's refactor **todos/index.ejs** as follows:

	```html
	    <% todos.forEach(function(t, idx) { %>
	      <li>
	        <a href="/todos/<%= idx %>"><%= t.todo %></a>
	```
	Don't forget to add the `idx` parameter in the callback function


- Refresh the page and hover over the links. Looking at the bottom-left of the window will verify the paths look correct!

- **Links always send an HTTP request using what HTTP method?**

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- The UI is set to send the proper HTTP requests to the server.

- However, clicking one of those links will display a<br>_Not Found 404_ error - this means that there is no route on the server that matches the HTTP request.

- Let's add one...

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- Add the **show** route below the **index** route as follows:

	```js
	router.get('/', todosCtrl.index);
	router.get('/:id', todosCtrl.show);
	```
	**The actual path is `/todos/:id` - right?**

- Saving will crash the app because there is no `todosCtrl.show` being exported from the controller...

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- Add the `show` action inside of **controllers/todos.js** and don't forget to export it!

	```js
	function show(req, res) {
	  res.render('todos/show', {
	    todo: Todo.getOne(req.params.id),
	    todoNum: parseInt(req.params.id) + 1
	  });
	}
	```

- Express's `req.params` object will have a property for each **route parameter** defined, for example...

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- A route defined like this:

	```js
	router.get('/category/:catName/page/:pageNo', ...);
	```
	and a link like this:
	
	```html
	<a href="/category/socks/page/2">Next Page</a>
	```
	would have a `req.params` available in the controller of:
	
	```js
	console.log(req.params.catName) //=> "socks"
	console.log(req.params.pageNo) //=> "2"
	```

- Note that all route param values are strings.

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>

- Another refresh informs us that the `show` action in the controller is calling a `Todo.getOne` method that doesn't exist.

- Let's fix that error! In **models/todo.js**:

	```js
	module.exports = {
	  getAll,
	  getOne
	};
	
	function getOne(id) {
	  return todos[id];
	}
	```

---
#### Adding Show a To-Do Functionality
<br>	

- Refresh and of course there's an error because we haven't created  the **views/todos/show.ejs** that we're trying to render.

- Copy the boilerplate from **views/todos/index.ejs** and then add this:

	```html
	<body>
	  <h1>Todo #<%= todoNum %></h1>
	  <h3><%= todo.todo %></h3>
	  <h3>Complete: <%= todo.done ? 'Yes' : 'No' %></h3>
	</body>
	```

- Refresh - BAM!
