# Create an API for an Express App

## Intro

Looking for some more practice exposing an API for an app?  Good!

## Lab Requirements

2. Install the Node modules: `$ npm install`.

3. Create a RESTful API for the `movies` resource that includes all 5 RESTful routes.

4. The `cast` property of each _movie_ document must be populated with the _performer_ documents.
